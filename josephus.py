# Josephus Problem
# There are n people standing in a circle (numbered clockwise 1 to n) waiting to be executed. 
# The counting begins at point 1 in the circle and proceeds around the circle in a fixed direction (clockwise). 
# In each step, a certain number of people are skipped and the next person is executed. The elimination 
# proceeds around the circle (which is becoming smaller and smaller as the executed people are removed), 
# until only the last person remains, who is given freedom.
# Given the total number of persons n and a number k which indicates that k-1 persons are skipped and kth 
# person is killed in circle. The task is to choose the place in the initial circle so that you are the last 
# one remaining and so survive.
# Consider if n = 5 and k = 2, then the safe position is 3.
# Firstly, the person at position 2 is killed, then person at position 4 is killed, then person at position 1 
# is killed. Finally, the person at position 5 is killed. So the person at position 3 survives.
