# Data-Structures-and-algorithms

This repository has personal notes and solved important coding questions. The basic implementations of data structures are done in python with reference with [Data structures playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDV1Zeh2NRsB6SWUrDFW2RmDotAfPbeHu) by WilliamFiset.

Any contributions to the repository are highly appreciated.
